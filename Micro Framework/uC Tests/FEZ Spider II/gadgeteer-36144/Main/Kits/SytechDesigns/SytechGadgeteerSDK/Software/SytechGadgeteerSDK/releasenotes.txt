13 Feb 2012 V1.0.5.0
All install package version numbers have been synchronised at 1.0.5.0
Kit install version and all module versions match.

IMPORTANT!!!!!!!
NANO Mainboard firmware has had support for LCD Configuration change from the application and
also Native BMP convert function added. Nano must have Micro Framework Build NANO_MXL_G firmware 
to support these new 'native' features. This is build 4.1.40912.54877 Dated 5 Jan 2012 or later
to work correctly.

Changes
NANO
Any Device Solution SDK dependant dlls are now installed with the NANO Mainboard firmware package.
There is no longer any requirement to install the DeviceSolution SDK - it is optional.
Added support for LCD Configuration changes to flash to be accessed from the application layer.
Added Native bitmap format convert function, so you can now use SPI displays such as the Seed OLED display

SerialCamera
Access tot he picture has been made more flexible. The OnPictureready event used to return a bitmap. It now returns
an EventArgs, containing a Gadgeteer.Picture instance. This can return either the image as a bitmap, for use on displays
or as the data buffer, for saving to files etc. The file data buffer format is JPEG.
Added a Camera Ready event, fired after the camera has finshed initialising on start up. Camera is ready to use when this event has fired.
