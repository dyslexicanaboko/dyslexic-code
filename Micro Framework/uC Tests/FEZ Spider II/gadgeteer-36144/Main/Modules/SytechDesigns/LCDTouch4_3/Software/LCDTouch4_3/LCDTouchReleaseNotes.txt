V 1.0.5.0
13 Feb 2012

Initial Release
Supports XVGA 480 * 272 pixels.
Supports Touch

Future Support
Screen Rotation and auto Touch Calibration functions.

Touch can be calibrated and settings persisted in EWR, as per normal Micro Framework methods, support
to be added to integrate this into Gadgeteer and allow calibration to be set to flash ( reqiures firmware change
in the NANO).

Support to be added to allow the display to be rotated and Gadgeteer core to understand this.
Display can currently be rotated, but Gadgeteer core will fight this on start up, detecting it as a different display
and resetting to the default setting for the display - cancelling the rotation!
Support to be added to change the Touch calibration to respond to display rotations.
