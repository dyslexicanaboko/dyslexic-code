-It seems that when running an application, the AVD has to be setup to handle that application's version.

-If you get the error message: "Cannot Resolve [widget name]", then make sure first that anything obvious
 is not broken. Try saving the project, then try recompiling the project. If this is for an event of some
 kind and multiple widgets are using a single listener, make sure that listener is declared before the
 widgets reference the listener.

-WARNING - Eclipse fucking sucks, so if you are seeing that a number of widgets cannot be resolved or they
 don't exists or they cannot be found, then make sure the imports are pointed to the right place.
 Example: you should be using "import android.view.View.OnClickListener;" if you see something else for the
 onClickListerns, then it is WRONG!
 Something I noticed is, you can just ignore and try to run anyhow, this will work if there really is no error.

-WARNING - Android SDK Fucking Sucks - If you try to assign an event listener for an item that is not visible
at the moment (setContentView(R.layout.layoutThatIsntInViewCurrently);) because the layout is not the current
layout being used, this will throw an exception.

-Every time you change views, the view loses its state, so this means that data is lost as well - specifically
the data that is related to the view, so the widgets and stuff that is on the form (form items).
 
Eclipse Notes:
============================================================
When it comes to moving workspaces and what not, eclipse is retarded about this.
So when we move workspaces, which will restart eclipse for some unknown reason,
you need to reimport all of your projects. Right click on the Package Explorer
and click on import, follow the obvious there.

If the Package Explorer is not visible, make it visible by going to
Window > Show View > Package Explorer.

When the "Layout" is referred to, use "main.xml"

If you are still recieving a build error for something you know is absolutely fine
and correct, then cut it out of the document, save, build, repaste and rebuild. If
you recieve another error then your coding is bad.
